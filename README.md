Key Features:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Includes data loading, handling missing values, feature engineering (e.g., one-hot encoding categorical variables, creating new features), and data splitting.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes data distributions, identifies correlations between features and survival, and explores potential biases.

AdaBoost Model Training: Trains an AdaBoost classifier with decision trees as base estimators.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilizes GridSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters for the AdaBoost model, such as the number of estimators and learning rate.

Model Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
