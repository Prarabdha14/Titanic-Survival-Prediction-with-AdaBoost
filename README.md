# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-with-AdaBoost
This repository explores the prediction of passenger survival on the Titanic using the AdaBoost algorithm. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data and feature engineering to improve model performance. GridSearchCV is used to find the optimal hyperparameters for the AdaBoost model.
